# MinimalAF CPP

A rewrite of my C# Minimal Application Framework for C++. 
I intend on using this to make something like a DAW, and C# may not have the performance characteristics that I will need.

I will also be dropping many features. 

TODO:
- Rewrite outline code to not use the poly-line renderer
- Remove polylines
- Remove ngons
- Add some way to do retained mode stuff. Check if we can already do this stuff first
